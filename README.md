# HUST.Project2.StockPricePrediction

In this project, we try to implement SOTA machine learning and deep learning models to predict price of a certain stock. There are mainly two parts in this repository: the notebook for training the data, and the python files to build a web application.

To see further information about how we select the dataset, how we visualizae, and how we train it, please check our notebook in the `notebook` folder

To run the web application, please first install the requirred packages by running following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

then run deploy the web interface using command:

```
uvicorn app:app
```
